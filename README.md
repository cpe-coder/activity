# 🕒 Web Development 1 Activity 3: Build a Digital Clock

## 📘 Overview

This activity will guide you in creating a simple **digital clock** using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The clock should display the current time and update every second in real time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Practice building webpage structure using **HTML**
- Style using **CSS** for layout and visual design
- Use **JavaScript** to dynamically update and display the time


## 🛠️ Instructions

1. **HTML (`index.html`)**
   - Create a basic page with a title
   - Add a `<div>` with an ID of `clock` to display the time

2. **CSS (`style.css`)**
   - Style the clock container to be centered on the page
   - Use custom fonts and colors to enhance appearance

3. **JavaScript (`script.js`)**
   - Use the `Date` object to get current time
   - Format time as `HH:MM:SS`
   - Update the time every second using `setInterval`

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Display must update every second
- Time format: `HH:MM:SS` (either 24-hour or 12-hour with AM/PM)
- No use of external libraries or frameworks
- Must work on any modern web browser

---

## 🔍 Bonus (Optional)

Add a toggle button that switches between **12-hour** and **24-hour** formats.

---

## 📤 Submission

- Submit your project as a `.zip` file on or before April 25, 2025
- **Filename format**: `DigitalClock_YourLastName_FirstName.zip`
- Inside the zip file should be: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`

---

## 💡 Tips

- Use `String().padStart(2, '0')` to ensure two-digit numbers
- Place your `<script>` tag just before `</body>`
- Use `display: flex` or `grid` to easily center elements
- Use any platform or tools that help you finish this activity
